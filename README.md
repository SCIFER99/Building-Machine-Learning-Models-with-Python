# Building-Machine-Learning-Models-with-Python
Build Linear Regression and Mean Absolute Error Models with Python for Machine Learning 

Here I am back with more Machine Learning stuff! (For now; more concepts coming soon!)

Step 1: Install these packages (if you have not done so already!)

        pip3 install sklearn
        pip3 install model_selection
        pip3 install LinearRegression
        pip3 install metrics
        pip3 intall pandas
        
Step 2: That's all folks! 

Happy Coding!
